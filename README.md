# Privilege-Recognition-Task

## 08/02 Week Tasks:
1. Bias as a gradient
2. A result screen after/questions screen before each level (Reach Min Viable Project after this step)
3. Updated AI to include semi-optimal movement (to be explained further in doc) + add AI to config
4. Create documentation for program setup

## Completed:

- 1 player vs 3 AI
- Multiple Rounds
- Record every input from the player (time-stamped by by game tick)
- Player moves up, down, left, right. Collect coins
- Experiment parameters: Coin distrobution, speed, number of rounds
- AI either has optimal, random, or "stay still" movement (random walk via markov chain)
- Feedback: Number of Coins per player/enemy
- Configuration for each "level"
